```swift
import Foundation
import VanMoofKit

let vanMoof = VanMoof()

try await vanMoof.login(
    username: "knight.rider@vanmoof.com",
    password: "********"
)

let bikes = try await vanMoof.bikes()

for bike in bikes {
    try await bike.connect()
    try await bike.play(sound: .bell)
}
```

## Disclaimer

> VanMoofKit is not an official library of [VanMoof B.V](https://vanmoof.com). This Swift Package makes certain features of the bike accessible which may be illegal to use in certain jurisdictions. As this library hasn't reached an official 1.0 version some features are currently not available or may not working as expected.

## Features

- [x] Access the VanMoof Web API through native Swift Code üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
- [x] Establish a bluetooth connection to a VanMoof Bike using async/await üö≤.
- [x] Easily change the configuration of the bike such as bell sound, power level, light mode and many more ‚öôÔ∏è
- [x] Combine support to react to changes of certain functions ‚õìÔ∏è

## Example

Check out the example application to see VanMoofKit in action. Simply open the `Example/Example.xcodeproj` and run the "Example" scheme.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/VanMoofKit.git", from: "0.0.1")
]
```

Or navigate to your Xcode project then select `Swift Packages`, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and search for `VanMoofKit`.

## Usage

As the VanMoofKit is using the [`CoreBluetooth`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth) framework to establish a [BLE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) connection to a bike the [`NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsbluetoothalwaysusagedescription) key needs to be added to the Info.plist of your application.

### VanMoof

To retrieve bikes of a VanMoof account you first need to initialize an instance of `VanMoof`.

```swift
let vanMoof = VanMoof()
```

The VanMoof API url and key are prefilled with default values which you can easily adjust, if needed.

```swift
let vanMoof = VanMoof(
    url: .init(string: "https://my.vanmoof.com/api/v8"),
    apiKey: "..."
)
```

To authenticate simply call the `login` function on instance of a `VanMoof` object.

```swift
try await vanMoof.login(
    username: "kight.rider@vanmoof.com",
    password: "********"
)
```

> The login credentials aren't persisted or logged they are only used to authenticate against the VanMoof API.

Make use of the `vanMoof.isAuthenticated` property to check if the user is already logged in.

```swift
if vanMoof.isAuthenticated {
    // ...
}
```

The login produces a `VanMoof.Token` which is automatically stored in an instance of a `VanMoofTokenStore`. You can configure the persistence of the token when creating an instance of `VanMoof`.

```swift
let vanMoof = VanMoof(
    // Specify an instance which conforms to the `VanMoofTokenStore` protocol.
    // Predefined implementations:
    // - UserDefaultsVanMoofTokenStore
    // - UbiquitousVanMoofTokenStore (iCloud Key-Value Store)
    // - InMemoryVanMoofTokenStore
    tokenStore: UserDefaultsVanMoofTokenStore()
)
```

After the login has succeeded you can retrieve the user profile and the associated bikes.

```swift
// Retrieve the user
let user: VanMoof.User = try await vanMoof.user()
print("Available Bikes", user.bikes)

// If you want to directly retrieve the bikes call:
let bikes: [VanMoof.Bike] = try vanMoof.bikes()
```

To logout the current user call:

```swift
vanMoof.logout()
```

> Note: Logging out an user has no effect on any available VanMoof.Bike instance. It is the developer responsibility to terminate any open connection to a VanMoof.Bike.

### Bike

### Details

Some information such as the name of the bike, frame number, MAC address are available without an active connection to the bike. You can access those information via the `VanMoof.Bike.Details`.

```swift
let details = bike.details
print(details.name)
print(details.macAddress)
print(details.frameNumber)

// Or access the details properties directly
// (powered by the @dynamicMemberLookup attribute)
print(bike.name, bike.macAddress, bike.frameNumber)
```

#### Connection

To establish a connection to a `VanMoof.Bike` call:

```swift
do {
    // Try to connect to the bike
    try await bike.connect()
} catch let bikeError as VanMoof.Bike.Error {
    print(bikeError.errorDescription, bikeError.underlyingError)
} catch {
    print(error)
}
```

You can retrieve the current state of the connection in the following way.

```swift
// Switch on connectionState
switch bike.connectionState {
case .disconnected:
    print("Disconnected")
case .discovering:
    print("Disconvering / Searching")
case .connecting:
    print("Connecting")
case .connected:
    print("Connected")
case .disconnecting:
    print("Disconnecting")
}

// Alternatively you can use a Publisher
bike.connectionStatePublisher
    .sink { connectionState in
        // ...
    }

// Or a specialized publisher which only emits connection errors
bike.connectionErrorPublisher
    .sink { connectionError in
        // ...
    }
```

If you wish to terminate the connection simply call:

```swift
// Disconnect from the bike
try await bike.disconnect()
```

#### Functions

A `VanMoof.Bike` exposes various functions and properties in order to modify certain functionality as well as getting notified whenever a value changes by making use of a publisher.

**ModuleState**

```swift
switch try await bike.moduleState {
case .on:
    break
case .off:
    break
default:
    break
}

bike.moduleStatePublisher.sink { moduleState in
    // ...
}

try await bike.set(moduleState: .on)

// Alias for setting the module state to on
try await bike.wakeUp()
```

**Battery Level**

```swift
// An integer in the range from 0 to 100
let batteryLevel: Int = try await bike.batteryLevel

bike.batteryLevelPublisher.sink { batteryLevel in
    // ...
}
```

**Speed Limit**

```swift
switch try await bike.speedLimit {
case .europe:
    print("Europe 25 km/h")
case .unitedStates:
    print("United States 32 km/h")
case .japan:
    print("Japan 24 km/h")
}

bike.speedLimitPublisher.sink { speedLimit in
    // ...
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Changing the speed limit may be illegal in certain jurisdictions.

```swift
try await bike.set(speedLimit: .unitedStates)
```

**Power Level**

```swift
switch try await bike.powerLevel {
case .off:
    break
case .one:
    break
case .two:
    break
case .three:
    break
case .four:
    break
case .maximum:
    break
}

bike.powerLevelPublisher.sink { powerLevel in
    // ...
}

try await bike.set(powerLevel: .four)
```

**Light Mode**

```swift
switch try await bike.lightMode {
case .auto:
    break
case .alwaysOn:
    break
case .off:
    break
}

bike.lightModePublisher.sink { lightMode in
    // ...
}

try await bike.set(lightMode: .alwaysOn)
```

**Bell Sound**

```swift
switch try await bike.bellSound {
case .sonar:
    break
case .bell:
    break
case .party:
    break
case .foghorn:
    break
}

bike.bellSoundPublisher.sink { bellSound in
    // ...
}

try await bike.set(bellSound: .party)
```

**Play Sound**

```swift
try await bike.play(sound: .scrollingTone)
try await bike.play(sound: .beepPositive)
try await bike.play(sound: .alarmStageOne)
```

**Sound Volume**

```swift
// An integer in the range from 0 to 100
let soundVolume: Int = try await bike.soundVolume
```

**Total Distance**

```swift
// Measured in kilometers
let totalDistance: Int = try await bike.totalDistance

bike.totalDistancePublisher.sink { totalDistance in
    // ...
}
```

**Unit System**

```swift
switch try await bike.unitSystem {
case .metric:
    break
case .imperial:
    break
}

bike.unitSystemPublisher.sink { unitSystem in
    // ...
}

try await bike.set(unitSystem: .metric)
```

**Firmware Versions**

```swift
let bikeFirmwareVersion: String = try await bike.bikeFirmwareVersion
let bleChipFirmwareVersion: String = try await bike.bleChipFirmwareVersion
let eShifterFirmwareVersion: String = try await bike.eShifterFirmwareVersion
```
